# What are Preview features, and how do I enable them? 

<!-- legacy procedure -->

Preview features are features that aren't complete, but are made available on a "preview" basis so customers can get early access and provide feedback. Preview features:  
  
- Are subject to separate [Supplemental Terms of Use](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=511446).  
  
- **Are not supported by [!INCLUDE[pn_Microsoft_Support](../includes/pn-microsoft-support.md)]**.  
  
- May have limited or restricted functionality.  
  
- Aren't meant for production use.  
  
- May be available only in selected geographic areas.  
  
## How do I enable a Preview feature?  
To enable a Preview feature, you must be an administrator.  
  
1. In the web app, go to **Settings** > **Administration**.
  
2. Select **System Settings**, and then select the **Previews** tab.  
  
3. Read the [Supplemental Terms of Use](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=511446), and if you agree, select the **I've read and agree to the license terms** check box.
