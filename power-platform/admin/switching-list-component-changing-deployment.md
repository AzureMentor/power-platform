# Switching from the list component or changing the SharePoint deployment

This topic provides an overview about how to switch from the list component to server-based authentication. This topic can also help if you change the [!INCLUDE[pn_ms_SharePoint_long](../includes/pn-ms-sharepoint-long.md)] deployment type, such as moving from [!INCLUDE[pn_SharePoint_short](../includes/pn-sharepoint-short.md)] on-premises to [!INCLUDE[pn_sharepoint_online](../includes/pn-sharepoint-online.md)].

## Switch from list component to server-based authentication  
 If your organization is already using the list component with [!INCLUDE[pn_ms_SharePoint_long](../includes/pn-ms-sharepoint-long.md)] for document management with model-driven apps in Dynamics 365, such as Dynamics 365 Sales and Customer Service, you can switch to server-based authentication by following these steps.  
  
1. Follow the steps to set up server-based [!INCLUDE[pn_SharePoint_short](../includes/pn-sharepoint-short.md)] integration that best fits your deployment type. For more information, see the appropriate topic for your [!INCLUDE[pn_SharePoint_short](../includes/pn-sharepoint-short.md)] deployment below.  


|Environment  |Topic  |
|---------|---------|
|Model-driven apps in Dynamics 365 and SharePoint Online  |   [Set up model-driven apps in Dynamics 365 to use SharePoint Online](set-up-dynamics-365-online-to-use-sharepoint-online.md)        |
|Model-driven apps in Dynamics 365 and SharePoint on-premises     |   [Configure server-based authentication with model-driven apps in Dynamics 365 and SharePoint on-premises](../admin/configure-server-based-authentication-sharepoint-on-premises.md)      |
  
   > [!NOTE]
   >  If you've made changes to [!INCLUDE[pn_SharePoint_short](../includes/pn-sharepoint-short.md)], such as new [!INCLUDE[pn_SharePoint_short](../includes/pn-sharepoint-short.md)] servers, new site collections, or migrated from [!INCLUDE[pn_SharePoint_short](../includes/pn-sharepoint-short.md)] on-premises to [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoft_sharepoint_online](../includes/pn-microsoft-sharepoint-online.md)], consider deactivating outdated [!INCLUDE[pn_SharePoint_short](../includes/pn-sharepoint-short.md)] site records. When you run the Enable Server-Based SharePoint Integration wizard, the wizard will attempt to validate all active [!INCLUDE[pn_SharePoint_short](../includes/pn-sharepoint-short.md)] sites. [!INCLUDE[proc_more_information](../includes/proc-more-information.md)] [Deactivate a site](../admin/switching-list-component-changing-deployment.md#BKMK_deact_site)  
  
2. Although it is not required for server-based authentication, we recommend that you deactivate and then delete the list component [!INCLUDE[pn_SharePoint_short](../includes/pn-sharepoint-short.md)] solution from the [!INCLUDE[pn_SharePoint_short](../includes/pn-sharepoint-short.md)] site collection. To do this, after you have confirmed that server-based authentication is enabled, in a web browser follow these steps. 
      1. Sign-in to the site collection, select the **Settings** button in the top-right corner, then **Site Settings**, and then under **Web Designer Galleries**, select **Solutions**. 
      2. Choose **crmlistcomponent**, and then on the tool bar select **Deactivate**. 
      3. Choose the **crmlistcomponent** again, and then on the tool bar select **Delete**.

## Changing the SharePoint deployment type  
  
1. After the migration of [!INCLUDE[pn_ms_SharePoint_long](../includes/pn-ms-sharepoint-long.md)] to either online or on-premises is completed, deactivate the outdated [!INCLUDE[pn_SharePoint_short](../includes/pn-sharepoint-short.md)] site records. You must do this because, when you run the Enable Server-Based SharePoint Integration wizard, the wizard will attempt to validate all active [!INCLUDE[pn_SharePoint_short](../includes/pn-sharepoint-short.md)] sites. [!INCLUDE[proc_more_information](../includes/proc-more-information.md)] [Deactivate a site](../admin/switching-list-component-changing-deployment.md#BKMK_deact_site)  
  
2. Follow the steps to set up server-based [!INCLUDE[pn_SharePoint_short](../includes/pn-sharepoint-short.md)] integration that best fits your deployment type. For more information, see the above section [Switch from list component to server-based authentication](#BKMK_switchlistcomp).

### Deactivate a site  
  
1. In the Power Platform admin center, select an environment. 

2. Select **Settings** > **Integration** > **Document management settings** > **SharePoint Sites**.  
  
3. Select the [!INCLUDE[pn_SharePoint_short](../includes/pn-sharepoint-short.md)] site you want to remove, and then on the tool bar select **Deactivate**.  
  
4. Repeat step three for all sites that you want to deactivate.  

### What to do when the Enable Server-Based SharePoint Integration wizard doesn't appear
If the **Enable Server-Based SharePoint Integration** icon doesn't appear in the **Document Management** area after you deactivate all SharePoint sites, follow these steps.
1. Select Advanced Find and create the following query. 
   - **Look for**: **SharePoint Sites** 
   - **Use Saved View**: **[new]**
   -  Select the down arrow next to the **Service Type** clause and then select **Delete** to remove it.

2. Add **Status** as a new clause, select **Active** as the value, and then select **OK**: 

    ![Select Active SharePoint Sites](media/select-active.png)

3. The **Status** clause appears like this. 

    ![Status clause](media/status-clause.png)

4. Select **Results**.
    In the list of active SharePoint sites returned by the query, select all records, and then on the toolbar, select **Deactivate**.
