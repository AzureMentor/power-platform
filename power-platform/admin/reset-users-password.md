# Reset a user's password

If a user loses a password, you can reset it. To reset a user’s password, you must be a [!INCLUDE[pn_ms_online_services_environment](../includes/pn-ms-online-services-environment.md)] global administrator, user management administrator, or password administrator.  
  
 For step-by-step instructions, see [Reset a User’s Password](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=255489).  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  The reset password is temporary. The user must change the temporary password at the next sign in. To help users meet the requirements for creating a new password in the [!INCLUDE[pn_ms_online_services_environment](../includes/pn-ms-online-services-environment.md)], see [Set a user's password expiration policy](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=255483).
