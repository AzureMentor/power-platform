# Manage Bing Maps for your organization

Learn how you can manage [!INCLUDE[pn_bing_maps](../includes/pn-bing-maps.md)] for your entire organization. When [!INCLUDE[pn_bing_maps](../includes/pn-bing-maps.md)] is turned on, people see a map of a customer's location when they view contacts, leads, or accounts.  
  
> [!IMPORTANT]
> Customer Engagement (on-premises) organizations may need to enter a Bing Maps Enterprise Key to use the maps feature. Go to the [Bing Maps licensing page](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=390116) for details on how to get a key.

## Turn Bing Maps on or off for your organization  
  
1. Browse to the Power Platform admin center and sign in using administrator credentials.
  
2. Go to **Environments** > [select an environment] > **Settings** > **Product** > **Features**.

3. Under **Embedded content**,  turn on **Bing Maps**.
  
4. Select **Save**.
