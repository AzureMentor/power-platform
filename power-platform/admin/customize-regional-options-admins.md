- Follow the steps in [View your user profile](https://docs.microsoft.com/dynamics365/customer-engagement/basics/view-your-user-profile).
- Don't have the correct permissions? Contact your system administrator.
  
1. Select an environment and go to **Settings** > **Business** > **Regional formatting**.

2. Select the check box **Enable the default country/region code**, and then choose a region code. 
  
3. Select the **Formats** tab.  
  
4. From the **Current Format** list, select the language and country or region, and then select **Customize**.  
  
5. In the **Customize Regional Options** dialog box, you can change the default settings for the selected format. View how the changes will look in the preview boxes.
