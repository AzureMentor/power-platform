# Control receiving social data

Based on market trends and strategic direction, we have decided to focus on providing insights about broader market patterns and customer trends by enhancing capabilities in other Microsoft products.
Effective January 16, 2020, Microsoft Social Engagement was discontinued for all Dynamics 365 customers and will no longer be included as part of any Microsoft Dynamics 365 license entitlement for new customers.
